#### Example of ``history.json``

```json
[  
{
    "id": 1,
    "timestamp": "2024-11-16T10:00:00Z",
    "classification_result": {"type1": 0.8, "type2": 0.15, "type3": 0.05},
    "model_version": "v1.0",
    "metadata": {"image_width": 224, "image_height": 224, "file_format": "JPEG"}
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "timestamp": "2024-11-17T14:30:00Z",
    "classification_result": {"type1": 0.6, "type2": 0.2, "type3": 0.2},

    "metadata": {"image_width": 224, "image_height": 224, "file_format": "PNG"}
  }
]

#### Explanation of File Structure and Purpose

---

##### **1. `/app` (Project Root Directory)**

- **Purpose**: This is the main directory of your application, containing all essential subdirectories and files.
- **Contains**:
  - Subdirectories like `/models/`, `/data/`, `/config/`, `/utils/`.
  - Core files such as `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `README.md`.

---

##### **2. `/models/` (Model Files Directory)**

- **Purpose**:
  - Stores trained machine learning or deep learning models.
  - Allows versioning of models to support updates and testing of different versions.
- **Contents**:
  - `model_v1.0.pt`: A trained model file, for example, in PyTorch format (`.pt`).
  - Additional versions of models (e.g., `model_v2.0.pt`) for testing or rollback.

---

##### **3. `/data/` (Data Storage Directory)**

- **Purpose**:
  - Stores application data such as classification history or logs (if needed).
  - Ensures historical records are saved and accessible for debugging or analysis.
- **Contents**:
  - `history.json`: A JSON file that records classification results and metadata about inputs, such as timestamps, model versions, and predictions.

---

##### **4. `/config/` (Configuration Directory)**

- **Purpose**:
  - Stores configuration files for the application, defining global settings.
  - Centralizes settings for easy modification without hardcoding them in the main application logic.
- **Contents**:
  - `config.json`: Contains key configurations like:
    ```json
    {
      "current_model_version": "v1.0",
      "image_size": [224, 224],
      "log_level": "INFO"
    }
    ```

    - Tracks the current model version.
    - Defines image preprocessing parameters, such as target size.

---

##### **5. `/utils/` (Utility Functions Directory)**

- **Purpose**:
  - Contains helper scripts and modular code to streamline the main application logic.
- **Contents**:
  - **`model_manager.py`**:
    - Manages loading, saving, and switching between model versions.
    - Ensures the correct model is loaded for inference.
  - **`history_manager.py`**:
    - Handles the creation, retrieval, and saving of classification history in `history.json`.
    - Keeps record updates and querying logic separate from the main application.
  - **`image_processor.py`**:
    - Implements image preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and format conversion.
    - Processes input images in memory before passing them to the model.

---

##### **6. `main.py` (Application Entry Point)**

- **Purpose**:
  - The starting point of the application where the main logic is implemented.
  - Orchestrates interactions between the utilities (`/utils/`), model (`/models/`), and configuration (`/config/`).
- **Typical Contents**:
  - Imports utilities like `model_manager.py`, `history_manager.py`, and `image_processor.py`.
  - Accepts user inputs (e.g., images), preprocesses them, runs the model, and logs or saves results.

---

##### **7. `requirements.txt` (Dependency List)**

- **Purpose**:
  - Lists all Python libraries and dependencies required to run the application.
- **Contents**:
  - Example:
    ```text
    torch==2.0.1
    numpy==1.25.2
    opencv-python==4.5.3
    flask==2.3.0
    ```

---

##### **8. `README.md` (Project Documentation)**

- **Purpose**:
  - Provides an overview of the application, including its purpose, setup instructions, and usage examples.
- **Contents**:
  - Description of the application (e.g., "A local image classification tool for skin cancer detection").
  - Steps to install dependencies and run the application.
  - Usage examples (e.g., command-line or API instructions).

#### Summary of Each Directory’s Role

| **Directory/File** | **Purpose**                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/models/`             | Stores trained models and supports version control.                                   |
| `/data/`               | Holds application data like classification history (`history.json`).                |
| `/config/`             | Stores configuration files to centralize and manage application settings.             |
| `/utils/`              | Contains modular utility scripts for model management, history, and image processing. |
| `main.py`              | Entry point for the application, orchestrating all functionality.                     |
| `requirements.txt`     | Lists required Python libraries for the application.                                  |
| `README.md`            | Documents the project, setup steps, and usage instructions.                           |
